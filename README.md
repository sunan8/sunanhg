👋 Hey there, I’m (@sunanhg)! <br/><br/>

🚀 **Tech explorer | Problem solver | Code enthusiast** <br/><br/>

## 🌟 About Me  
• 👀 I’m interested in **AI, automation, and creative coding**. If it’s cutting-edge, I’m probably trying to break it (or fix it). <br/>  
• 🌱 Currently learning **how to make applications by thinking through problems, machine learning, DevOps, and full-stack development**—because why not master it all? <br/>  
• 💞️ Looking to collaborate on **kind developers willing to share their open-source projects with me!** Give me your code to use as open source, and I’ll happily test your cool app. If there’s a bug or a problem, I’ll let you know—but fixing it? That’s on you! 😆 <br/>  
• 😄 Pronouns: **He/Him** <br/>  
• ⚡ Fun fact: **I can probably debug your code faster than I can decide what to eat for dinner.** <br/><br/>
