👋 Hey there, I’m (@sunanhg)!

🚀 Tech explorer | Problem solver | Code enthusiast

🌟 About Me
	•	👀 I’m interested in AI, automation, and creative coding. If it’s cutting-edge, I’m probably trying to break it (or fix it).
	•	🌱 Currently learning how to make applications by thinking through problems, machine learning, DevOps, and full-stack development—because why not master it all?
	•	💞️ Looking to collaborate on kind developers willing to share their open-source projects with me! Give me your code to use as open source, and I’ll happily test your cool app. If there’s a bug or a problem, I’ll let you know—but fixing it? That’s on you! 😆
	•	😄 Pronouns: He/Him
	•	⚡ Fun fact: I can probably debug your code faster than I can decide what to eat for dinner.
